this is a simple dadbot made in golang

what does it do: 
  it'll respond to messages starting with i'm with a obligitory dadjoke
  ex: "im hungry"
  "hi hungry i'm dad"

no commands and is pretty simple

to build you'll need golang and the disgord library installed

to run you'll need to copy the template config file and paste it as "config.json"
and then fill out the bot token part of the config with your bot token

then you can just run the executable file
